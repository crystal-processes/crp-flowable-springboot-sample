# Goal:
The sample application should show how "easy" you can do something. The purpose of this sample application is to show,
how difficult is to solve problems caused by misleading samples. I do not have a name for this kind of sample. 
Let's name it fix-sample application.

Even my 15+ years in BPM and 10+ years with jBPM, Activiti and Flowable, is not enough to find and cover everything. 
I would like to encourage anybody, who has a problem to [write an issue to the project](https://github.com/crystal-processes/crp-flowable-springboot-sample/issues), or even better to contribute 

# Step 01 - Basic spring boot and model application
The first step is dedicated to an ordinary sample application. 
## [Initial spring boot and flowable application](docs/01_sample/01-initialApp.md)
No problem till now, just follow doc. (flowable, spring boot...)
## [Hello World application model](docs/01_sample/02-helloWorld.md)
:beetle: How to test and make assertions in the model?
